# Linear Algebra Types

Inside this module, the linear algebra data types required are defined. 
These are: MyVector, MyBasis, MyReferenceFrame, MyPoint and MyParticle.
They are defined in the diagram below:


In addition, some useful functions have also been created to assist in changing of
reference frame, rotating vector basis, and more.
